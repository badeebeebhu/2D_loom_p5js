# 2D_loom_p5js
2D weaving of images, using p5.js. Can change thickness of and gap between warp and weft, as well as image selection (which you have to create a list of in the code). The loom will show what image you are looking at. Note that in this version, the image is refreshed each time it is selected, and does not refresh after you've reached the end.
